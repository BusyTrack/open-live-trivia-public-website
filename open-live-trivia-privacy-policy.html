    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2> 
    <p> 
      BusyTrack built the Open Live Trivia app as a free, open-source app. This SERVICE is provided by BusyTrack at no cost and is intended for use as is. In this document, the app will be referred to as <i>Service</i>.

    <p>
      This page is used to inform users regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.
    </p> 
    <p>
      If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

      <strong>Information Collection and Use</strong>
    </p> 
    <p>For a better experience while using my Service, I may require you to provide certain personally identifiable information. The information that I request through the Service is retained on your device and on the server powering the Service, hosted and maintained by myself. More specifically, that information is the Firebase User Id (sent to my server when you authenticate with your Google account), the Firebase Authentication Token which is used for user authentication and the user name you choose to use inside the Service.</p> 
    <p>The app does use third party services that may collect information used to identify you, such as the Android Advertising ID.</p>
